##Dynamic Log Parser
Designed to take a file/string as input and parse it based on a, traditionally, RegEx evaluation of the contents and creates a DynamicObject which can then be used for further analysis.

The purpose behind this project was to simplify output generated by applications through a generic interface allowing for rapid definition of additional schema.
